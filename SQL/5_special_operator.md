# SPECIAL OPERATOR

## IN-OPERATOR : (MULTI - VALUED OPERATOR)

- 'IN' is a special operator which can compare multiple values of RHS to the single value of LHS.
- 'IN' operator returns true if any one of the condition at RHS is satisfied.

### SYNTAX :

```
 col-name/Expression IN (v1,v2,v3,........Vn)
```
### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD NAME OF EMPLOYEES WORKING IN DEPT 10,20,30,40.

```
 SELECT ENAME FROM EMP
 WHERE DEPTNO IN (10,20,30,40);
```

2. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEES WORKING IN DEPT 10 OR 20 OR 30.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE DEPTNO IN (10,20,30);
```

3. WAQTD NAME OF THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS WORKING AS MANAGER IN DEPT 10,20.

```
 SELECT ENAME FROM EMP

```

## NOT IN OPERATOR :

- 'NOT IN' operator works similar to 'IN OPERATOR' which can compare multiple values at RHS to the single value of LHS.
- Instead of selecting, it will reject the values which are matching the condition.

### SYNTAX :

```
 col-name/Expression NOT IN (v1,v2,v3.........Vn);
