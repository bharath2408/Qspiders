# SPECIAL OPERATOR

## IN-OPERATOR : (MULTI - VALUED OPERATOR)

- 'IN' is a special operator which can compare multiple values of RHS to the single value of LHS.
- 'IN' operator returns true if any one of the condition at RHS is satisfied.

### SYNTAX :

```
 col-name/Expression IN (v1,v2,v3,........Vn)
```
### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD NAME OF EMPLOYEES WORKING IN DEPT 10,20,30,40.

```
 SELECT ENAME FROM EMP
 WHERE DEPTNO IN (10,20,30,40);
```

2. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEES WORKING IN DEPT 10 OR 20 OR 30.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE DEPTNO IN (10,20,30);
```

3. WAQTD NAME OF THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS WORKING AS MANAGER IN DEPT 10,20.

```
 SELECT ENAME FROM EMP
 WHERE JOB='MANAGER' AND DEPTNO IN (10,20);
```

4. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE WORKING AS SALESMAN OR ANALYST OR MANAGER IN DEPT 30.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE JOB IN ('SALESMAN','ANALYST','MANAGER') AND DEPTNO IN 30;
```

5. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE WORKING AS CLERK OR MANAGER IN DEPT 10,20 WHOSE EARNING MORE THAN 1000.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE JOB IN ('CLERK','MANAGER') AND DEPTNO IN (10,20) AND SAL>1000;
```

## NOT IN OPERATOR :

- 'NOT IN' operator works similar to 'IN OPERATOR' which can compare multiple values at RHS to the single value of LHS.
- Instead of selecting, it will reject the values which are matching the condition.

### SYNTAX :

```
 col-name/Expression NOT IN (v1,v2,v3.........Vn);
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD DETAILS OF ALL THE EMPLOYEES EXPECT THE EMPLOYEE FOR WORKING AS MANAGER (OR) PRESIDENT.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE JOB NOT IN ('MANAGER','PRESIDENT');
```

## BETWEEN OPERATOR :

- Between operator is used whenever we have the range of values.
- Between operator returns true if the values is within the range.

### SYNTAX :

```
 col-name/expression BETWEEN LOWER RANGE AND HIGHER RANGE;
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE  WHOSE SALARY IS IN THE RANGE OF 1000 AND 4000.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1000 AND 4000;
```

2. WAQTD EMPLOYEE NAME,SAL AND DESIGNATION FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES WHOSE SALARY IS BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000.

```
 SELECT ENAME,SAL,JOB FROM EMP
 WHERE SAL BETWEEN 1001 AND 2999;
```

3. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE WHO HIRED BETWEEN 81 AND 87.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE HIREDATE BETWEEN '01-JAN-82' AND '01-JAN-86';
```

4. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE ALONG WITH ANNUAL SALARY WHO HIRED DURING 81

```
 SELECT EMP.*,SAL*12 FROM EMP
 WHERE HIREDATE BETWEEN '01-JAN-81' AND '31-DEC-81';
```

## NOT BETWEEN OPERATOR :

- NOT BETWEEN operator works similar to between, instead of selecting it will reject the value which is within the range

### SYNTAX :

```
 COL-NAME/EXPRESSION NOT BETWEEN LOWER RANGE AND HIGHER RANGE;
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD ENAME AND SALARY FOR AL THE EMPOYEES EXCEPT THE EMPLOYEES WHO IS EARNING IN THE RANGE OF 1250 TO 3000.

```
 SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP
 WHERE SAL NOT BETWEEN 1250 AND 3000;
```

## IS OPERATOR :

- IS OPERATOR  is used to compare only with the NULL.

### SYNTAX :

```
 COL-NAME/EXPRESSION IS NULL
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS NOT EARNING ANY COMMISSION.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE COMM IS NULL;
```

2. WAQTD ENAME,EMPNO FOR THE EMPLOYEES WHO DON'T HAVE ANY REPORTING MANAGER.

```
 SELECT ENAME,EMPNO FROM EMP
 WHERE MGE IS NULL;
```

## IS NOT OPERATOR :

- IS NOT OPERATOR is used to compare with NOT NULL.

### SYNTAX :

```
 COL-NAME/EXPRESSION IS NOT NULL;
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS EARNING COMMISSION.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL;
```

2. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEE ALONG WITH ANNUAL SALARY IF THEIR EARNING SALARY BUT NOT COMMISSION.

```
 SELECT EMP.*,SAL*12 FROM EMP
 WHERE SAL IS NOT NULL AND COMM IS NULL;
```

## LIKE OPERATOR ;

- LIKE OPERATOR is used to perform pattern matching.
- We can achieve pattern matching with the help of two special character **'%'** and **'_'**.

>**Note**
> % and _ known as wild characters.

### % - percentile

- It can accept any character.
- It can accept any number of character.
- It can accept no character.

### _ - underscore 

- it can accept any characters but it can accept only one character.

>**Note**
> There should not be space within the single quotation because the space considered as one character.

### SYNTAX

```
 COL-NAME/EXPRESSION LIKE 'PATTERN-TO-MATCH';
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD DETAILS OF THE EMPLOYEES WHOSE NAME STARTS WITH S.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE ENAME LIKE 'S%';
```

2. WAQTD ENAME, SAL FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES WHOSE NAME STARTS WITH M AND ENDING WITH N (M%N).

```
 SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP
 WHERE ENAME LIKE 'M%N';
```

3. WAQTD ENAME AND EMPID FOR ALL THE EMPLOYEES WHO'S NAME HAS CONSECUTIVE L.

```
 SELECT ENAME,EMPNO FROM EMP
 WHERE ENAME LIKE '%LL%';
```

4. WAQTD DETAILS OF ALL THE EMPLOYEES WHO'S NAME HAS A HAS SECOND CHARACTER AND ENDING WITH S.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME LIKE '_A%S';
```

## NOT LIKE OPERATOR :

- NOT LIKE OPERATOR WORKS SIMILAR TO LIKE OPERATOR INSTEAD OF SELECTING IT WILL REJECT THE VALUES WHICH IS MATCHING THE PATTERN.


### SYNTAX :

```
 COL-NAME/EXPRESSION NOT LIKE 'PATTERN TO MATCH';
```

### EXAMPLE :

1. WAQTD DETAILS OF ALL THE EMPLOYEES EXCEPT THE EMPLOYEES WHO NAMES STARTS WITH A.

```
 SELECT * FROM EMP
 WHERE ENAME NOT LIKE 'A%';
```
